  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

    <h1>GOD of War</h1>
    <p>"I am Kratos, the Ghost of Sparta."<br></p>

     <p> "I was once a Spartan warrior, feared on the battlefield, relentless in my pursuit of victory. In my thirst for power, I pledged my soul to Ares, the God of War, only to be betrayed—forced to slaughter my own wife and daughter. Their ashes cling to my skin, a curse that binds me to my past, a constant reminder of my sins."<br></p>
      
      <p>"I sought vengeance, cutting down gods and titans alike, tearing Olympus apart until no god remained to challenge me. But rage is a beast that devours its master, and I was left with nothing but the echoes of my destruction."<br></p>
      
      <p>"I abandoned Greece, seeking refuge in a distant land, the realm of Midgard. There, I found purpose once more—not in war, but in fatherhood. My son, Atreus, is my second chance. But the gods of this world do not suffer my kind to live in peace. They come, seeking battle, seeking blood."<br></p>
      
      <p>"I will not seek war, but I will not run from it. For I am Kratos, and I have slain gods before."</p>
